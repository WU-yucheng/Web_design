(# mean the wrods were recored last class)
flower

html:
# use html5 to be the structure of code

# add header
#     nav
# use list to be the btn of nav

add class to 'nav ul'
add class to 'nav ul li' 

css:
set UTF-8
set all margin & padding to 0

header & ul flex to let logo & navigation display flex
li deafult display is list-item, so need to set 'display block'

use father container '.icon' to set the blank area between icons. can use margin to set child
icon_fb & icon_ig & icon_line use 'background-image', because will use 'hover' later to change the image
add ':hover' after the selector can set the effect when mouse hover the area

'.menu' use the similar skill with '.icon'
